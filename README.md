# Character Sheets for Ages of madness

So I have made a quick little app/webpage to have your character sheets on, the goal of this was simply;
1. to get something out there fast
   1. one of the consequences of doing something fast is that the interface has some "shortcuts" and maybe very personal
      interpretation of "intuitive".
2. that it should primarily be used on a smartphone.

## Character Sheet

### Søren's experience
I have added Søren's special experience for skills "thing". So if you click on the name of the skill, you'll get one
point of experience. It then counts up to the point where you could roll, at that point it changes colour. If you want
start over / remove the points, then click on it (the number with the surrounding circle.)

### Changing values
There is an edit slider, top left corner. Which will allow you to change the value of skills, name, birthplace etc
Please note that with editing enabled there are a few buttons down in the bottom, for things that doent happen often, 
one of them is to upload a new image for the top.

Please note that there are a few places that still allow you to edit, even though your >not< in edit mode. 
1. Hit Points,
2. Sanity
3. Luck
4. Magic points

## Dashboard
This could be renamed to "Keepers page", and only visible to Søren. But I wanted everyone to be able to see it before I
hide it away.

#### Messages
Søren can click or one or several, and send them a message.

#### Roll
More a proof of concept, but I wanted to be able to roll a spot hidden against selected characters. The idea being that
they shouldnt know that there is something hidden to roll against, or whether they succeeded... I suppose disguise could
work too...
